### Websockify
Current client uses websockets so we need to websockify incomming traffic.
This is because I don't want this to be web exclusive.

NOTE: Don't remember anymore how I had configured websockify.
I think you create python venv in which u install websockify.
To run the server, you first have to activate the venv and use start.sh
to get the traffic through..
