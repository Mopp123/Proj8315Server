Serverside factions
-------------------
    * Factions aren't updated/fetched in database since these are so dynamic entities
    * Currently factions live only inside "Game" - object
    TODO:
        * System to backup game data including factions


state updater
-------------
    for each tile containing object
     -> run correct "behaviour" code for this object (may alter surrounding tiles' states)


stats
-----
    * Easy way of creating "unit/object/effect, etc" stat sheets, which can be queried by client.
    These stats contain info how different objects, etc behave on the server, what "skills" and abilities they have.
